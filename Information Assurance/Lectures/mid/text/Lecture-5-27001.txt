ISO/IEC 27001:2005

Introduction


ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is an ISMS standard published in October 2005 by the
Internal Standards Organization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission.



It formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring
information security under explicit management control.



Being a formal specification means that it mandates specific requirements



Organizations that claim to have adopted ISO/IEC 27001can therefore be
formally audited and certified compliant with the standard

How the Standard Works


Most organizations have a number of information security controls



However, without ISMS, controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and
disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific
situations or simply as a matter of convention



Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of IT or data
security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and
proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole



Moreover business continuity planning and physical security may be managed
quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources
practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign
information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.

..contd


ISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:
◦ Systematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking
account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;
◦ Design and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information
security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance
or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and
◦ Adopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information
security controls continue to meet the organization's information security
needs on an ongoing basis.

Benefits of 27001


It can act as the extension of the current quality system to include security



It provides an opportunity to identify and manage risks to key information
and systems assets



Provides confidence and assurance to trading partners and clients; acts as
a marketing tool



Allows an independent review and assurance to you on information
security practices

A company may want to adopt ISMS for the following reasons
 It is suitable for protecting critical and sensitive information
 It provides a holistic, risk-based approach to secure information and
compliance
 Demonstrates credibility, trust, satisfaction and confidence with
stakeholders, partners, citizens and customers
 Demonstrates security status according to internationally accepted criteria
 Creates a market differentiation due to prestige, image and external
goodwill
 If a company is certified once, it is accepted globally.


Certification


An ISMS may be certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 by a number
of Accredited Registrars worldwide



In some countries, the bodies that verify conformity of management
systems to specified standards are called "certification bodies", while in
others they are commonly referred to as "registration bodies",
"assessment and registration bodies", "certification/ registration bodies",
and sometimes "registrars“



Certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC
27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited
certification body is functionally equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC
27001 itself.

Auditing


Stage 1 is a preliminary, informal review of the ISMS, for example checking the existence
and completeness of key documentation such as the organization's IS Policy, SoA(Service
oriented architecture) . This stage serves to familiarize the auditors with the organization
and vice versa.



Stage 2 is a more detailed and formal compliance audit, independently testing the ISMS
against the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001. The auditors will seek evidence to
confirm that the management system has been properly designed and implemented, and is
in fact in operation. Certification audits are usually conducted by ISO/IEC 27001 Lead
Auditors. Passing this stage results in the ISMS being certified compliant with ISO/IEC
27001.



Stage 3 involves follow-up reviews or audits to confirm that the organization remains in
compliance with the standard. Certification maintenance requires periodic reassessment audits to confirm that the ISMS continues to operate as specified and
intended. These should happen at least annually but (by agreement with management) are
often conducted more frequently, particularly while the ISMS is still maturing.
