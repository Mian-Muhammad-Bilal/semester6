Lecture - 2

Introduction
• In reality, organizations have many other things to do than
practice security. Businesses exists to make money
• No organization specifically deploys and maintain firewalls,
intrusion detection systems, identity management
technologies, and encryption devices
• No business really wants to develop hundreds of security
policies, deploy antimalware products, maintain vulnerability
management systems, constantly update their incident
response capabilities, and have to comply with the alphabet
soup of security regulations

What is Needed?
• But these simpler days are long gone. Now organizations are
faced with attackers who want to steal businesses’ customer
data to carry out identity theft and banking fraud
• Company secrets are commonly being stolen by internal and
external entities for economic espionage purposes. Systems
are being hijacked and being used within botnets to attack
other organizations or to spread spam
• Each organization must develop an enterprise- wide security
program that consists of technologies, procedures, and
processes

Security Triad

Availability
• Ensuring the availability of the necessary resources within an
organization sounds easier to accomplish than it really is
• Networks have so many pieces that must stay up and running (routers,
switches, DNS servers, DHCP servers, proxies, firewalls).Software has
many components that must be executing in a healthy manner (operating
system, applications, antimalware software)
• There are environmental aspects that can negatively affect an
organization’s operations (fire, flood, electrical problems), potential
natural disasters, and physical theft or attacks
• An organization must fully understand its operational environment and
its availability weaknesses so that the proper countermeasures can be
put into place.

Integrity
• Environments that enforce and provide this attribute of
security ensure that attackers, or mistakes by users, do not
compromise the integrity of systems or data
• When an attacker inserts a virus, logic bomb, or back door into
a system, the system’s integrity is compromised
• Users usually affect a system or its data’s integrity by mistake.
For example, users with a full hard drive may delete config
files under the mistaken assumption that deleting a boot.ini
file is okay.

Confidentiality
• Confidentiality can be compromised by a variety of means
from shoulder surfing to social engineering.
• Users can intentionally or accidentally disclose sensitive
information by not encrypting it before sending it to another
person, by falling prey to a social engineering attack, by
sharing a company’s trade secrets, or by not using extra care
to protect confidential information when processing it.

Balanced Security
• In reality, when information security is dealt with, it is commonly
only through the lens of keeping secrets secret (confidentiality).
• The integrity and availability threats can be overlooked and only
dealt with after they are properly compromised
• Some assets have a critical confidentiality requirement (company
trade secrets), some have critical integrity requirements (financial
transaction values), and some have critical availability requirements
(e-commerce web servers)
• Many people understand the concepts of the AIC triad, but may not
fully appreciate the complexity of implementing the necessary
controls to provide all the protection these concepts cover

CONTROLS
ISMS Implementation

27

Security Controls
• After studying the AIC triad and understanding the concept of
vulnerability, exploit, threat and risk, we move on to studying
controls which help safeguard the information of any
organization.
• Controls are put into place to reduce the risk an organization
faces, and they come in three main flavors:
• Administrative
• Technical
• Physical

Administrative Controls
• Administrative controls are commonly referred to as “soft
controls” because they are more management-oriented.
Examples of administrative controls are security
documentation, risk management, personnel security, and
training
• Technical controls (also called logical controls) are software or
hardware components, as in firewalls, IDS, encryption,
identification and authentication mechanisms
• Physical controls are items put into place to protect facility,
personnel, and resources. Examples of physical controls are
security guards, locks, fencing, and lighting

Defense in Depth
• These control types need to be put into place to provide
defense-in-depth, which is the coordinated use of multiple
security controls in a layered approach
• A multilayered defense system minimizes the probability of
successful penetration and compromise because an attacker
would have to get through several different types of
protection mechanisms before she gained access to the critical
assets

..contd

Controls Categorized
• So the different categories of controls that can be used are
administrative, technical, and physical. But what do these controls
actually do for us?
• We need to understand the different functionality that each control
type can provide us in our quest to secure our environments.
• The different functionalities of security controls are preventive,
detective, corrective, deterrent, recovery, and compensating
• By having a better understanding of the different control
functionalities, you will be able to make more informed decisions
about what controls will be best used in specific situations

..contd
• Deterrent Intended to discourage a potential attacker
• Preventive Intended to avoid an incident from occurring
• Corrective Fixes components or systems after an incident has
occurred
• Recovery Intended to bring the environment back to regular
operations
• Detective Helps identify an incident’s activities and potentially
an intruder

..contd
• When looking at a security structure of an environment, it is
most productive to use a preventive model and then use
detective, recovery, and corrective mechanisms to help
support this model.
• Basically, you want to stop any trouble before it starts, but you
must be able to quickly react and combat trouble if it does
find you.
• It is not feasible to prevent everything; therefore, what you
cannot prevent, you should be able to quickly detect

Preventive Controls : Admin
• Policies and procedures
• Effective hiring practices
• Pre-employment background checks
• Controlled termination processes
• Data classification and labeling
• Security awareness

Preventive Controls : Physical
• Badges, swipe cards
• Guards, dogs
• Fences, locks, mantraps

Preventive Controls : Technical
• Passwords, biometrics, smart cards
• Encryption, secure protocols, call-back systems, database
views, constrained user interfaces
• Antimalware software, access control lists, firewalls, intrusion
prevention system

Examples
• A firewall tries to prevent something bad from taking place, so
it is a preventative control.
• Auditing logs is done after an event took place, so it is
detective
• A data backup system is developed so that data can be
recovered; thus, this is a recovery control
• Computer images are created so that if software gets
corrupted, they can be loaded; thus, this is a corrective
control.

Compensating Control
• Controls that provide an alternative measure of control
• If your company needed to implement strong physical security, you
might suggest to management that security guards are employed. But
after calculating all the costs of security guards, your company might
decide to use a compensating (alternate) control that provides similar
protection but is more affordable—as in a fence
• you are a security administrator and you are in charge of maintaining
the company’s firewalls. Management tells you that a certain protocol
that you know is vulnerable to exploitation has to be allowed through
the firewall for business reasons. The network needs to be protected
by a compensating (alternate) control pertaining to this protocol,
which may be setting up a proxy server for that specific traffic type to
ensure that it is properly inspected and controlled

Control Effectiveness
• Effectiveness measures whether the Control provides an
acceptable level of risk mitigation to the organization.
• A Control may exist (for example, the organization maintains a
Policy requirement that all employees must change their
password every 30 days), but its value is diminished it it is not
properly implemented (few employees are aware of the
requirement and there is manageable evidence passwords are
not being changed).

Control Efficiency
• Efficiency measures the cost of maintaining the Control
compared to the potential loss if the Control were to fail. This
is a cost/benefit analysis where Controls are ideally structured
to yield a positive return on investment.

Control Scope
• In order to measure the effect from a Control failure, you need
to correlate the Scope of the Control (does the Control
mitigate the Risk from the loss of Confidentiality, Integrity or
Availability) with the Impact of the process (how important is
a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability to the process)
• If a Control addresses a loss of Availability, but under Impact
Availability is rated as a low risk element, the overall risk from
the failure of the Control is likely Low
• Conversely, if the Impact assessment rated Availability as a
high risk area, then the failure of the Availability Control would
have a significant effect on the organization

Control Complexity
• How difficult is it to exploit the Control?
• Does the exploit require significant resources (i.e. experience,
training, money, technology, planning etc.)
• In effect, the greater the complexity involved in breaking the
Control, the less likely the Control will be exploited.

Control Access
• What level of access to the control is required for an exploit to
be successful?
• Is the Control freely accessible on the Internet or is the Control
protected within a guarded data center?
• How many people (potential Threats) could access the Control
with the resources reasonable available to them?

Control Priviledge
• Assuming the Threat can overcome the challenges of
Complexity and Access, what level of Privilege will the Threat
receive?
• For example, a hacker (the Threat) may be able to run a script
(an exploit) to gain access to an Internet site
• The severity of the exploit would vary greatly based on the
level of authority or privilege that the hacker would gain. If the
exploit only allows the Hacker to run reports on the system, it
would have a lower severity than if the exploit gave the Hacker
system administrator access with the power to change or
delete code, monitor user activity, etc.

Security Through Obscurity
• The concept of security through obscurity is assuming that your enemies
are not as smart as you are and that they cannot figure out something
that you feel is very tricky
• A nontechnical example of security through obscurity is the old practice
of putting a spare key under a doormat in case you are locked out of the
house
• You assume that no one knows about the spare key, and as long as they
don’t, it can be considered secure.
• The vulnerability here is that anyone could gain easy access to the house
if they have access to that hidden spare key, and the experienced attacker
(in this example, a burglar) knows that these kinds of vulnerabilities exist
and takes the appropriate steps to seek them out

STO : Examples
• Some vendors work on the premise that since their product’s
code is compiled this provides more protection than products
based upon open-source code because no one can view their
original programming instructions.
• But attackers have a wide range of reverse-engineering tools
available to them to reconstruct the product’s original code,
and there are other ways to figure out how to exploit software
without reverse-engineering it, as in fuzzing, data validation
inputs, etc.

STO : Examples
• Another common example of practicing security through
obscurity is to develop cryptographic algorithms in-house
instead of using algorithms that are commonly used within the
industry. Some organizations assume that if attackers are not
familiar with the logic functions and mathematics of their
homegrown algorithms, this lack of understanding by the
attacker will serve as a necessary level of security. But
attackers are smart, clever, and motivated
• The better approach is to use industry-recognized algorithms
that have proven themselves to be strong and not depend
upon the fact that an algorithm is proprietary, thus assuming
that it is secure

STO : Examples
• Some network administrators will remap protocols on their
firewalls so that HTTP is not coming into the environment over
the well-known port 80, but instead 8080. The administrator
assumes that an attacker will not figure out this remapping,
but in reality a basic port scanner and protocol analyzer will
easily detect this port remapping.
• So don’t try to outsmart the bad guy with trickery; instead,
practice security in a mature, solid approach

Competent Security Programme
• A security program is a framework made up of many entities:
logical, administrative, and physical protection mechanisms,
procedures, business processes, and people that all work together
to provide a protection level for an environment
• Each has an important place in the framework, and if one is missing
or incomplete, the whole framework may be affected
• The program should work in layers: one layer provides support for
the layer above it and protection for the layer below it
• Because a security program is a framework, organizations are free
to plug in different types of technologies, methods, and procedures
to accomplish the necessary protection level for their environment.

Example
• Let us take the mail server as an example. We need to list down the
threats to the mail server
• Power failures
• Hardware failure
• Virus attacks and Malicious code injection by intruders (Hacking)
• Denial of Service (DoS attack)
• Mail accidentally sent to a different recipient
• Data corruption/Data loss
• Unauthorized Access
• Connectivity Issues
• Natural Calamities

..contd
• Since we know that, Mathematically:
Risk Value = Asset Value x Business Impact x Probability of occurrence of threat

• Now Asset value is defined by looking at
• Confidentiality
• Integrity
• Availability

•

Asset value = Confidentiality + Availability + Integrity

..contd
• Let us take the mail server of the organization.
• Let us define a scale of 1-5 to record and assign a value to the owners and
custodians views.
QUESTION
What if an intruder or another employee of a lower access level gets to
read confidential top management mails?
ANSWER
It is very critical. Since the top management exchanges a lot of information
through emails.
• So the confidentiality value is 4 (FOUR)

QUESTION
• What if an intruder or another employee tries to modify the contents
of the mail and the mail delivered is something different.
• For ex: The CEO sends out a mail to the CFO to donate Rs.1,00,000 for
a charity. Someone in between tampers the mail and changes the
amount to Rs.7,00,000 and give his account number.
ANSWER
It is very critical.
• So the integrity value is 4 (FOUR)

QUESTION
What happens if there is a hardware failure and the server is not available
to the organization?
ANSWER
It is not very critical. My servers run on redundancy and I have a created a
backup. If there is a hardware failure, the backup server will take over and
there will not disruption to the services



So the availability value is 2 (TWO)

Asset Value

• Since we know that

Asset Value = Confidentiality + Availability + Integrity
• So the Asset Value of Mail Server is

Mail Server Value= 4 + 4 + 2 = 10

Calculating BI
• Risk Value = Asset Value x Business Impact x Probability of occurrence of
threat
• BIA is performed to analyze the impact on the business due to various
unprecedented events or incidents
• BIA is based on time. If there is a server crash, let's take the mail server as
the example above, how much time can the organization go without an
email server. This is derived by doing the business impact analysis
• Scale 1-5

• Since mail server is critical to the organization, we shall take 4 as the BIA
value

Calculating Probability of Occurrence
• Risk Value = Asset Value x Business Impact x Probability of
Occurrence of Threat
• The probability of occurrence is required to understand the
frequency at which such failures occur
• This is based upon previous experiences and also looking at the
current implementation.
• The probability of occurrence is measured on a scale of 0.1 to 1

Let us consider the probability of
occurrence to be rated at medium i.e.
0.4 for mail server

Calculating RISK Value
• Since, we have all the values now, so we will calculate the Risk value
by summing them all

Risk Value = AV x BI x P(T)
• Risk Value= 10 x 4 x 0.4 = 16
