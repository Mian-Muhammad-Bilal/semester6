OCTAVE APPROACH

What is OCTAVE


Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation
is a suite of tools, techniques, and methods for risk based
information security strategic assessment and planning.



The OCTAVE approach was developed by the Software
Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University in 2001
to address the information security compliance challenges
faced by the US Government Departments.

..contd


The OCTAVE approach is a framework that enables
organizations to understand, assess and address their
information security risks from the organization's perspective



OCTAVE is not a product, rather it is a process-driven
methodology to identify, prioritize and manage information
security risks



OCTAVE is self directed, people from an organization assume
responsibility for setting the organization’s security strategy.

..contd


Unlike typical technology focused assessment, which is targeted
at technological risk and focus mainly on technical security
issues, OCTAVE is focused on strategic and practical issues faced
by the organization which encompass quite a lot more than
technology.

IT

Organizational Needs


So in Octave Business and IT work together to address the
security needs of an organization balancing the three aspects of
Operational Risk, Security Practices, and technology

Benefits of OCTAVE


Operational Risks and Security Practices drive OCTAVE



Technology is examined only in relation to security practices in order to further refine them



OCTAVE helps in making information protection decisions based on risks to CIA



All aspects of risk (A,T,V,BI) are accounted for in decision making enabling an organization
to match a practical protection strategy to its security risks

..contd


OCTAVE is intended to help organizations

Develop Risk Evaluation criteria based on Business Needs

Identify assets that are critical to the mission of the organization

Identify vulnerabilities and threats to the critical assets
Determine and evaluate potential consequences to the organization if
threats are realized
Initiate corrective actions to mitigate risks and create practical protection
strategy

Characteristics of OCTAVE


OCTAVE is an asset-driven evaluation approach
◦

Identify information-related assets (e.g., information and systems) that are
important to the organization

◦

Focus risk analysis activities on those assets judged to be most critical to the
organization

◦

Consider the relationship among critical assets, the threats to these assets, and
vulnerabilities (both organizational and technical) that can expose assets to
threats

◦

Evaluate risks in an operational context and see how assets are at risk due to
security threats

◦

Create a practical protection strategy for organizational improvement as well as
risk mitigation plans to reduce the risk to the organization’s critical assets

OCTAVE Phase - I

Build Asset-Based Threat Profiles
• Critical assets
• Security requirements for critical assets
• Threats to critical assets
• Current Security practices

OCTAVE Phase - II

Identify Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
• Evaluation of the information infrastructure
• Examine NW access levels and access mechanism
• Assessing vulnerabilities associated with assets
• Assess what type(s) of attacks can harm your critical assets
• Identify the assets which are susceptible to these attacks

OCTAVE Phase - III

Develop Security Strategy and Plans
• Risk to critical assets
• Risk Measures
• Protection strategy
• Risk mitigation plans

Workshops


In applying the three phase approach, a progressive series of workshops are
required within the organization. These workshops requires comprehensive
interaction among the participants.



There are two types of workshops
◦
◦



The team leader is responsible for
◦
◦
◦



Facilitated discussions with various members of organization
Activities conducted by the analysis team on its own

Guiding all workshop activities and ensuring timely completion.
Ensuring all participants understand their roles
Selecting a decision-making approach (e.g. consensus, majority vote) during the workshops

Every phases might have a different leader.
◦
◦

Person with strong communication and interview skills can lead the 1st phase
Person with strong planning and analysis skills can lead phase 3.

Octave Processes


Octave method is broken into eight processes. Four in phase 1,
two in phase 2, two in phase 3.

Preparation
Getting Senior Management Sponsorship
• Top success factor in IS risk evaluations
• If senior management does not support, staff support will dissipate quickly

Selecting Analysis Team
• The team should have necessary skills and training to lead evaluation
• They should know how to apply their knowledge when required

Setting Appropriate Scope
• Mention important areas
• Scope should be limited initially but not to small

Selecting Participants
• Don’t call and engage who’s available, people should be part of analysis team and workshop
due to their knowledge

Phase 1: Build Asset Based Threat Profiles


In phase-1 you begin to build the organizational view of OCTAVE
by focusing on the people in the organization .
1: Identify Senior Management knowledge
• SM’s view of assets
• Areas of concern
• Security Requirements
• Current Security Practices
• Current Organizational Vulnerabilities

2: Identify Operational Area management Knowledge
• OA’s management view of assets
• Areas of concern
• Security Requirements
• Current Security Practices
• Current Organizational Vulnerabilities

3: Identify Staff Knowledge
• Staff’s view of assets
• Areas of concern
• Security Requirements
• Current Security Practices
• Current Organizational Vulnerabilities

4: Create Threat Profile
• Critical Assets
• Security Requirements for critical assets
• Threats to critical Assets

Process 1-3


The analysis team facilitates knowledge oriented workshops during
process 1-3



Participants from across the organization contribute their unique
perspective about what is important to the organization (assets) and
how well those assets are being protected



Senior managers are the audience in process 1, middle managers in 2
and technical staff in process 3.



So far four activities are undertaken
◦
◦
◦
◦

Identification of assets and relative priorities
Identify areas of concern
Identify security requirements for most important assets
Capture knowledge of current security practices and organizational vulnerabilities

Process 4: Create Threat Profile


Participants in this process are analysis team members. During
process 4, the team identifies the assets that are most critical
and describes how these assets are threatened.



Process 4 comprises of
◦
◦
◦
◦

Consolidating information from processes 1 to 3
Selecting critical assets
Refining security requirements for critical assets
Identifying threats to critical assets

Threat Profile


A threat profile is a structured way of presenting a range of
threats to a critical asset.



In the OCTAVE Method, threats are represented in the profile
using the following
◦ Asset— something of value to the enterprise
◦ Actor— who or what may violate the security requirements (confidentiality,
integrity, availability) of an asset
◦ Motive (or objective)— whether the actor's intentions are deliberate or
accidental (applies only to human actors)
◦ Access— how the asset will be accessed by the actor, e.g., network access,
physical access (applies only to human actors)
◦ Outcome— the immediate outcome (disclosure, modification, destruction,
loss, interruption) of violating the security requirements of an asset

Phase II: Identify Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
5. Identify Key Components
• Upon completion of process 4 you identified your organization's critical assets
and examined the threats to those assets. In process 5 you use this information
to determine how to evaluate your organization's computing infrastructure for
technology vulnerabilities
• You need to focus on the vulnerability evaluation to complete it in an efficient and
effective manner
• To understand your risk, you need to collect vulnerability information only on key
components relative to the critical assets. Process 5 enables you to identify those
key components.
• It comprises of two activities
• Identifying key classes of components
• Identifying infrastructure components to be examined

Technology Vulnerabilities


Ultimately, your goal during phase 2 of OCTAVE is to identify technological
weaknesses in the computing infrastructure



Technology vulnerabilities are weaknesses in systems, devices, and components
that can directly lead to unauthorized action



Technology vulnerabilities are present in and apply to network services,
architecture, operating systems, and applications



Three types of vulnerabilities
◦ Design Vulnerability
◦ Implementation Vulnerability
◦ Configuration Vulnerability

6. Evaluate Selected Components
• Participants in this process are the analysis team and selected
members of the IT staff
• Ultimate objective of process 6 is to identify technological weaknesses
in the infrastructure components that were identifies during process 5.
• It comprises of two activities
• Running vulnerability analysis tools on selected infrastructure
components
• Reviewing technology vulnerabilities and summarizing results

Phase III: Develop Security Strategy and
Plans


This phase is designed to make sense of information you have
gathered so far in the evaluation.



It is during this phase that you develop security strategies and plans
designed to address your organization’s unique risks and issues

7. Conduct Risk Analysis
• Participants in this process are the analysis team members
• Goal of process 7 is to identify and analyze risks to the organization’s
critical assets
• It comprises of three activities
• Identifying impact of threats to critical assets
• Creating Risk evaluation criteria
• Evaluating the impact of threats to critical assets

8. Develop Protection Strategy

• This process includes two workshops
• Participants in first workshop for process 8 are the analysis team
members and selected members of the organization (ISMF)
• The goal of process 8 is to develop a protection strategy for the
organization, mitigation plans for the risks to the critical assets and an
action list of future actions.
• In the second workshop, the analysis team presents the proposed
protection strategy, mitigation plans, and action list to senior managers
in the organization.
• The senior managers review and revise the strategy and plans as
necessary and decide how to move on
