Procrastination
• Procrastination Derives from two roots: Pro (Forward) + Crastinus
(Tomorrow)
• It is the habit of delaying or postponing tasks until the last possible
moment. It can be a major obstacle to effective time management,
leading to missed deadlines, increased stress, and reduced
productivity. The root causes of procrastination can vary, from fear of
failure or lack of motivation, to poor time management skills.
• Procrastinators use “Why do today what can be put off until
tomorrow?” Instead of “Why put off to tomorrow what can be done
today”

Forms of Procrastination

• Ignoring the task, hoping it will go away
• Underestimating how long it will take/overestimating your abilities
and resources
• Telling yourself that poor performance is okay/insisting on
perfection
• Doing something else that isn’t very important
• Believing that repeated “minor” delays won’t hurt you
• Talking about rather than doing it
• Putting all your work on only one part of the task
• Becoming paralyzed when having to make choices

How to Overcome Procrastination
• Win the mental battle by committing to being on time.
• Set and keep deadlines.
• Organize, schedule & plan.
• Divide a big job into smaller ones.
• Find a way to make a game of your work or make it fun.

priorities and deadlines.

Learn to say “No!”
• Avoid the temptation to socialize when you’ve scheduled work.
• If friends ask you to join them last minute, decline outright, but
ask if you could get together later in the week.
• Socializing is important when you don’t have other things to worry
about!
• Study somewhere you won’t be tempted to chat, watch movies or
YouTube, or use social utilities like Facebook.
• Texts are a major distraction.
