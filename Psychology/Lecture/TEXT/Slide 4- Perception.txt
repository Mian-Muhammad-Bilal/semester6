Perception

Sensation and Perception
• Sensation
– The process through which the senses pick
up visual, auditory, and other sensory stimuli
and transmit them to the brain; sensory
information that has registered in the brain
but has not been interpreted
• Perception
– The process by which sensory information is
actively organized and interpreted by the
brain

Perception
Gestalt principles of perceptual
organization
• Figure-ground

– Organization depends on what we see as figure
(object) and what we perceive a ground (context).

• Similarity

– Objects that have similar characteristics are
perceived as unit.

• Proximity
– Objects close together in space or time perceived
as belonging together.
• Continuity
– We tend to perceive figures or objects as
belonging together if they appear to form a
continuous pattern.
• Closure
– We perceive figures with gaps in them to be
complete.

Perception

• You can see a white vase as figure against a
black background, or two black faces in profile
on a white background

Depth Perception
• Depth perception

– The ability to see in three dimensions and to
estimate distance

• Monocular depth cues
– Depth cues that can be perceived by only one eye
–

Perception
• Monocular depth cues
– Types of cues
• Motion parallax
– When you ride in a moving vehicle and look out the
side window, the objects you see outside appear to be
moving in the opposite direction
– Objects seem to be moving at different speeds – those
closest to you appear to be moving faster than those in
the distance
– Objects very far away, such as the moon and the sun,
appear to move in the same direction as the viewer

Perception
• Binocular depth cues

– Depth cues that depend on two eyes working
together
– Convergence

• Occurs when the eyes turn inward to focus on nearby
objects – the closer the object, the greater the
convergence

Motion Perception

Perception
• Ambiguous figures
– Can be seen in different ways to make different
images
– Best known ambiguous figure is “Old Woman/Young
Woman,” by E. G. Boring

Perception
• Impossible figures
– Do not seem unusual at first
– Figures that cannot be built

• Illusion
– A false perception of actual stimuli involving a
misperception of size, shape, or the relationship of
one element to another

● Müller-Lyer Illusion
– The two lines above are the same length, but the diagonals
extending outward from both ends of the lower line make it look
longer than the upper line
