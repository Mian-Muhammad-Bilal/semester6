Learning
Sumaira Ayub

• Learning is a relatively permanent change in
behavior that is brought about by experience, and the
frequency of its occurrence; this change is not
automatic and results from practice or experience
• Learning usually refers to improved performance,
acquisition of skills, and a positive change in
behavior; however the change may also be negative
in nature

• Learning is distinguished from behavioral changes
arising from such processes as maturation and illness,
but does apply to motor skills, such as driving a car,
to intellectual skills, such as reading, and to attitudes
and values, such as prejudice.
• There is evidence that neurotic symptoms and
patterns of mental illness are also learned behaviors.

Types/ Forms of Learning
Considering the content of what has been learnt,
there are varieties of learning:
– Verbal learning
– Motor learning
– Problem solving

Verbal Learning
• Basically man is a verbal learner who learns about the
environment through experiences.
• Verbal learning involves the person’s own
association, experiences and relations with the
phenomenon that has been learned.

Motor Learning
• It involves the practical application of the learned
phenomena.
• There are various tasks/ activities in which motor
skills are of primary importance as compared to the
ones requiring verbally learned material; e.g. learning
the skills like playing football, tennis, cricket etc.; or
the training of technicians whose motor skills need to
be highly efficient.
• In learning motor skills two things are important;
quickness of movements and the results that are
achieved through it.

Problem Solving
• Problem solving tasks usually involves trial
and error and primarily include verbal
processes.
• While doing the problem-solving task,
individual learns many responses that can be
helpful for him in different situations

How Do We Learn?
• Three main explanations of learning are:
– Classical conditioning
– Operant conditioning
– Cognitive approaches to learning.

1. Classical Conditioning
• Why are children scared of darkness?
• Why some children jump with joy at the sight of a cat
and some start screaming in fright?
• Why does one coming from office start feeling
relaxed at the very sight of his home?
• Why does one start feeling bad at the thought of
going to a dentist?
• Why does one starts feeling hungry at the sight of
one’s favorite fast food joint?

• Classical conditioning provides answers to all
these questions
• Classical conditioning forms an association
between two stimuli.
• Classical Conditioning is when a stimulus acquires
the ability to cause a response that was previously
caused by another stimulus. This learning process
essentially allows us to predict what is going to
happen.

• Conditioned Drug Response
– Vomiting inducing drugs were repeatedly paired with the
sound of a tone; eventually the mere sound of that tone
could produce the same vomiting response. Consider the
children who vomit at the name of cough syrup, or who
faint at the name of a clinic.

• Smoking, Coffee, and Tea
– People who are addicted to caffeine and nicotine start
feeling relaxed and stimulated even before the intake.

• Over Eating
– Most obese people start feeling hungry at the sight of a
restaurant or at the smell of food.

• Classical Conditioning and the Immune System
– Studies on rats have shown that a neutral stimulus like
saccharin sweetened water when repeatedly paired with an
immuno-suppressant drug, started eliciting the same
response; the very taste of saccharin had the same effect on
immune system. functioning.
– Objects associated with a state of low immunity may lead
to a low immunity state in future.

• Classical Conditioning and the School Psychology
– An overly strict school atmosphere may lead to school
phobia, or test fear
– The same rule can be applied to develop a positive feeling
for school by making the school environment pleasant.

2. OPERANT CONDITIONING
• Type of learning in which a voluntary response
becomes stronger or weaker depending on its positive
or negative consequences.
• The organism plays an active role and ‘operates’ on
environment to produce the desired outcome.

• Why do teachers give silver and gold stars on children’s
workbooks?
• Why do horses gallop faster when the rider whips them?
• Why do parents allow children to watch cartoons when they
finish their homework in time?
• Why do we find surprise gifts in the packs of detergents?
• Why do employees who earn profit to the organization get a
bonus at the end of year? And,
• Why do children show temper tantrums in the presence of
guests even when they know the
• mother is going to scold and punish?
• The answers to all these questions can be found in the
operant conditioning approach

Shaping
• Rewarding successive approximation of a
desired behavior is called shaping.
• Desired behaviors can be acquired through
reinforcement or punishment.
• Reinforcement is the process by which a
stimulus or an event (a reinforcer) following a
a particular behavior increases the probability
that the behavior will happen again.

Types of reinforcement
• Positive reinforcement: the frequency of a behavior
increases becauseit is followed by the presentation of
something that increases the likelihood of that
behavior. E.g., if someone you meet smiles at you after
you say “hello, how are you?” and you keep talking,
the smile has reinforced your talking.
• Negative reinforcement: the frequency of a behavior
increases becauseit is followed by removal of
something. E.g., if TV is making some irritating sound,
you might give it a good smack on the side, and if the
buzzing stops, you are more likely to smack the set
again if buzzing resumes.

Punishment
• Punishment, is a consequence that decreases the
likelihood that a behavior will occur because of its
unpleasant consequences. .
• Types
• Positive punishment, a behavior decreases when
it is followed by the presentation of a stimulus.
E.g., spanking a misbehaving child.
• Negative punishment, a behavior decreases when
a stimulus is removed. E.g., time out .

• Four Possible Consequences
1. Something Good can start or be presented: behavior
increases = Positive Reinforcement (R+)
2. Something Good can end or be taken away: behavior
decreases = Negative Punishment (P-).
3. Something Bad can start or be presented: behavior
decreases = Positive Punishment (P+).
4. Something Bad can end or be taken away, so behavior
increases = Negative Reinforcement (R-)

• Punishment is sometimes confused with
negative reinforcement. Reinforcement
increases behavior while punishment is meant
to decrease it

• Token Economy/ Token System:
– The person is rewarded with some form of a token
every time a desired behavior is exhibited.
– The token can be play money/token or a chip
representing money; it can be the silver or gold stars
earned by the child; parents can give different
colored paper tokens for good behavior.
– After a specific number of tokens have been earned,
they can be exchanged for something desirable.

Applications of Operant Conditioning in
Real Life Situations
• Child rearing
• Classroom management
• Teaching of skills
• Animal taming
• Advertising
• Learning healthy life style

3. Observational learning
• Bandura’s Observational learning occurs when
a person observes and imitates someone else’s
behavior. It is also called imitation or
modelling.
• Bandura described four main process in
observational learning.
1. attention: to reproduce a model’s action you
must attend what the model is saying.

2. Retention: to reproduce a model’s action, you
must encode the information and keep it in the
memory so that you can retrieve.
3. Motor production: This requisite of behavior
concerns the physical and mental ability of the
individual to copy the behavior he or she observed.
4. Reinforcement/ Motivation: Perhaps the most
important aspect of observational learning involves
motivation. If the human or animal does not have a
reason for imitating the behavior, then no amount
of attention, retention, or reproduction will
overcome the lack of motivation.

Cognitive factors in learning
• Tolman emphasized the purposiveness of
behavior. Purposiveness refers to Tolman’s
belief that much of the behavior is goal
directed.
• Kohler developed the concept of insight
learning, a form of problem soving in which
the organism develops a sudden insight into or
understanding of a problem.
