Attention

Attention
• It is the process of directing and focusing certain psychological
resources to enhance perception, performance, and mental experience.
We use attention:
– to direct our sensory and perceptual systems toward certain stimuli,
– To select specific information for further processing,
– to ignore or screen out unwanted stimuli,
– to allocate the mental energy required to process selected stimuli,
and
– to regulate the flow of resources necessary for performing a task or
coordinating several tasks at once.

Characteristics of Attention

• Psychologists have discovered three important characteristics of
attention.
• First, it improves mental processing; you often have to concentrate
attention on a task to do your best at it. If your attentional system
temporarily malfunctions, you might drive right past Barney’s Diner.
• Second, attention takes effort. Prolonged concentration of attention can
leave you feeling drained (McNay, McCarty, & Gold, 2001). And when
you are already tired, focusing attention on anything becomes more
difficult.
• Third, attentional resources are limited. If your attention is focused on
reading this book, for example, you’ll have less attention left over to
listen to a conversation in the next room.

Directing Attention
•Attention is selective; it is like a spotlight that illuminates different parts
of the external environment or various mental processes.
•Control over attention can be voluntary and knowledge based or
involuntary and driven by environmental stimuli.

Ignoring Information
•When the spotlight of your attention is voluntarily or involuntarily
focused on one part of the environment, you may ignore, or be “blind”
to, stimuli occurring in other parts. This phenomenon, called
inattentional blindness, can be helpful when it allows us to ignore
construction noise while we are taking an exam.
•Magicians take advantage of inattentional blindness when they use
sudden movements or other attention-grabbing stimuli to draw our
attention away from the actions that lie behind their tricks.

Divided Attention
•Although there are limits to how well people can divide attention,
they can sometimes attend to two tasks at once. People can
sometimes divide their attention in ways that allow them to do
more than one thing at a time, a skill sometimes called
multitasking. You can drive a car, listen to the radio, sing along,
and keep a beat by drumming on the steering wheel, all at the
same time.
•For example, tasks that have become automatic can often be
performed along with more demanding tasks, and tasks that
require very different types of processing, such as gardening and
talking, can be performed together because each task depends
on a different supply of mental resources.
