Personality

Personality is the pattern of enduring
characteristics that produce consistency and
individuality in a given person. Personality
encompasses the behaviors that make each of us
unique and that differentiate us from others.
Personality also leads us to act consistently in
different situations and over extended periods of
time.

Defining Some Terms
• Character: Personal characteristics that have been
judged or evaluated
• Temperament: Hereditary aspects of personality,
including sensitivity, moods, irritability, and
adaptability
• Personality Trait: Stable qualities that a person shows
in most situations
• Personality Type: People who have several traits in
common

How do psychologists define
and use the concept of
personality?

1. Psychodynamic approaches to
Personality
• It emphasize that personality is primarily unconscious
(that is, beyond awareness). According to this viewpoint,
those enduring patterns that make up personality are
largely unavailable to our conscious awareness, and they
powerfully shape our behaviors in ways that we cannot
consciously comprehend.
• Psychodynamic theorists also stress the role of early
childhood experience in adult personality. From this
vantage point, the adult is a reflection of those childhood
experiences that shape our earliest conceptions of
ourselves and others.

2. Trait Approaches
• Approaches that propose that there are certain traits
that form the basis of an individual’s personality.
• These approaches seek to identify the basic traits
necessary to describe and understand personality.

Eysenck’s Dimensions of Personality
Two major dimensions:
– Introversion-extroversion,
– Neuroticism-stability.

• Introvert
– Quiet, passive, and careful people.

• Extroverts
– Outgoing, sociable, and active people.

• Neurotics
– Moody, touchy, and anxious people.

• Stable
– Calm, carefree, and even-tempered people.

3. Social Cognitive Perspectives
• Social cognitive theory states that behavior,
environment, and person/ cognitive factors are
important in understanding personality. In Bandura’s
view, these factors reciprocally interact. Two key
concepts in social cognitive theory are self-efficacy
and personal control.
• Self-efficacy is the belief that one can master a
situation and produce positive outcomes. Selfefficacy is also linked with successful job
interviewing, job performance, and achievement in a
creative profession.

• Personal control refers to individuals’ beliefs about
whether the outcomes of their actions depend on their
own internal acts or on external events.
• Imagine someone—let’s call him Raoul—who is excited
by the challenge of a new assignment given by his boss.
Raoul may think about all the possible strategies to
complete the project and get down to work immediately.
Yet this go-getter may respond differently to other
challenges, depending on who gives the assignment,
what it is, or whether he feels he can do a good job

4. Humanistic Perspectives
• Humanistic perspectives stress a person’s capacity for personal
growth and positive human qualities. Humanistic psychologists
believe that we all have the ability to control our lives and to
achieve what we desire.
• Maslow developed the concept of a hierarchy of needs, with selfactualization being the highest human need.
• In Rogers’s approach, each of us is born with a tendency toward
growth, a sense of what is good and bad for us, and a need for
unconditional positive regard. Because we are often denied
unconditional positive regard, we may become alienated from our
innate growth tendencies. In order to reconnect with these innate
tendencies, Rogers felt, a person required a relationship that
included unconditional positive regard, empathy, and genuineness.

• If we have innate tendencies toward growth and
fulfillment, why are so many people so unhappy? The
problem arises when our need for positive regard
from others is not met unconditionally.
• Unconditional positive regard is Rogers’s term for
being accepted, valued, and treated positively
regardless of one’s behavior.

Personality Assessment
• Interview: Face-to-face meeting designed to gain
information about someone’s personality, current
psychological state, or personal history
– Unstructured Interview: Conversation is informal,
and topics are discussed as they arise
– Structured Interview: Follows a prearranged plan,
using a series of planned questions
• Direct Observation: Looking at behavior

Self report Measures
• Self report test, which directly asks people whether
specific items describe their personality traits. Selfreport personality tests include items such as:
– I am easily embarrassed.
– I love to go to parties.
– I like to watch cartoons on TV.
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)
• used to assess “abnormal” personality tendencies
• a tool for hiring decisions
• in forensic settings it is used for assessing criminal risk
• Honesty (Integrity) Test: Assumes that poor attitudes toward
dishonest acts predispose a person to dishonest behavior

Inkblot

• What are this man and woman thinking and
feeling? How did they come to this situation,
and what will happen next?
• A psychologist who uses the TAT would
analyze your story to find out your
unconscious motives.

Other Types of Personality Assessments
• Behavioral Assessment: Recording the frequency of specific
behaviors
• Situational Test: Real life situations are simulated so that
someone’s spontaneous reactions can be recorded
• Leaderless Group Discussion: Test of leadership that
simulates group decision making and problem solving
