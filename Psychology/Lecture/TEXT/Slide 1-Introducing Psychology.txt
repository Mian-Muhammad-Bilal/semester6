social setting.

Definition
The scientific study of behavior and mental processes. It
encompasses not just what people do but also their
thoughts, emotions, perceptions, reasoning processes,
memories, and even the biological activities that
maintain bodily functioning.
• Scientific study
• Mental processes
• Behavior

Goals of psychology
• To Describe
The first goal of psychology is to describe how humans and animals
behave in different situations. Through continued observation we
can define what kind of behavior is considered normal or healthy
and what may be seemed as abnormal or unhealthy.
• To Explain
• Why does this behavior occur? Under what circumstances will it
occur again? In order to explain a behavior, psychologists must
conduct experiments to ensure that the behavior is not an
anomaly. They have to consider which factors trigger certain
behavior, as well as formulate certain theories which will help
explain the same.

• To Predict
• Based on past observed behavior, a psychologist aims to
predict how that behavior will appear again in the future
and if other people will exhibit the same behavior. Being
able to correctly predict occurrences of certain behavior is
very important, as with this understanding, models can be
developed to encourage positive behavior and find methods
to modify or control negative behavior.
• To Control
• The final goal of psychology is to control or modify certain
types of behavior based on observation.

Example
• Someone did something that they weren't supposed to do that had a
negative impact on their life. You want to try to help/solve the problem
and naturally, the following questions might run through your mind:
• "What happened?" (describing),
• "Why did she do that?" (explaining),
• "What would happen if she did this?" (predicting)
• "What can she do next time to have a different outcome?" (changing).
• The main difference between us asking these questions and
psychologists and professional mental health professionals asking these
questions is that there is a high level of education and training in the
explaining, predicting and changing process that facilitates lasting
positive change for individuals.

Importance of psychology

(development, personality, thoughts and behavior)
